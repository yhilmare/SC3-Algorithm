# SC3-Algorithm
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This project is about an article published at Nature Method, the url of this article is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5410170/">here</a>. This article give us an efficient method about clustering biology information. I reproducted the sources based on the method that the article gave, and I publish these on the Github. If there are any mistakes, please point out them for me. I will thank this so much.
<h2>Code</h2>
If you want to run this project, you are supposed to <code>git clone</code> this project firstly. This project also needs the data set provided by the author of this article, and you can login this <a href="http://bioinfo.uncc.edu/SNNCliq/">website</a> to download the data set.<br/>You have to name the dataSet after "scRNAseq_CountTable.csv" whatever the original name of the data set is.<br/>
Now, you have got the data set. We suppose that you have clone this project, and this project consists of three package, kmaneslib, PCA and Units. You are supposed to move the data set to the same folder that those packages located in.<br/>
At last, you can open your cmd and type <code>python ./Units/SC3Unit.py</code>. This program needs about 4.5 hours to run.
